      The term Greenfield stands in the figurative sense for a new start "on a
      greenfield site". Greenfield software development refers to developing a
      system for a totally new environment and requires development from a clean
      slate – no legacy code around. It is an approach used when you're starting
      fresh and with no restrictions or dependencies. Though a new system in
      place of the old brings challenges, it also opens up possibilities that
      are not yet thought of.

    <h1 class="mp-title">Legacy Migration</h1>
    <p class="mp-body">
      Modernizing old, outdated business applications can boost productivity,
      efficiency and transform your organization. A legacy application is a
      software program or application that is outdated or obsolete. Typically,
      they’re on-premises applications or programs that companies have relied
      upon for years. They include everything from QuickBooks, sales or CRM
      applications to custom and industry-specific applications. A legacy
      migration is when a company moves outdated software, platforms or
      applications from an on-premises server to the cloud. Due to the lack of a
      need, cost, potential obstacles can cause companies to not change outdated
      practices. However, maintaining the status quo can hold a business back,
      especially when it comes to their IT environment. Problems such as
      rebooting, restarting computers, difficulty in onboarding new users, poor
      backup management and access to information, inability to support multiple
      offices or remote staff could lead to inefficiency of performance and
      weakening of security.
      <br />
      By migrating your legacy application to the cloud, you use the cloud
      provider’s infrastructure, reducing your maintenance, software and
      licensing costs. Plus, you only pay for what you need, reducing overhead
      IT costs. <br />
      <br />
      On the downside, legacy applications typically aren’t well-protected.
      Locally hosted software often can’t be updated, leaving your business
      vulnerable to viruses, data loss, intellectual property and identity
      theft. Legacy applications also don’t typically have a reliable backup or
      data recovery plan to restore data in the event of loss or damage.
      <br /><br />
      Legacy applications are slow. They can take forever to load, are
      frustrating to use and difficult for new employees to learn. Storing vast
      amounts of data and applications on legacy systems and expecting them to
      perform on par with today’s more advanced technology isn’t feasible.
      Migrating your business application to the cloud means employees can
      access data easily when and where they need it. Legacy migration has
      compatibility issues. SaaS applications. Updated operating systems.
      Smartphones and mobile devices. Legacy systems are incompatible with many
      elements of modern IT infrastructure. As a result, many organizations have
      a cobbled together IT environment that doesn’t fit their needs.
      <br /><br />
      Migrating your business apps to the cloud upgrades your entire IT
      infrastructure and allows you to configure an environment that meets your
      modern business needs. Tracking and upgrading underlying server software
      is time-consuming and often requires business downtime. Cloud services &
      applications are continually improved, updated and expanded based on
      customer feedback and experimentation. In many instances, upgrades occur
      automatically in the cloud. With the shared resources of thousands of
      cloud users, you benefit from the collective insight, with access to
      updates, features and improvements to optimize your work experience.
      Legacy applications typically require Windows devices to access them. Many
      businesses use Mac devices, especially third-party partners, vendors,
      freelancers and consultants. Additionally, employees often use mobile
      devices to check their email in off hours. Cloud-based data and
      applications make your data available 24/7 to your employees. Employees
      and consultants can access data when and where they need it, and multiple
      users can share and work on the data at the same time.
